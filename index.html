    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hey, I'm Adrian. I'm currently studying computer science at my local community college, and in the midst of that, I'm transferring to a four-year university to pursue my bachelor's in computer science. I love to code, go on runs, and hit the gym with my friends. I have experience with Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and C++. And also know my way around tools such as Node.js, React.js, and Tailwind CSS. Please check out my website below and leave any feedback. Thanks!

        <h3>Stock Dashboard</h3>
        <p>I extracted data from all stocks listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange (NASDAQ) with the help of Finnhub's Application Programming Interface (API) and then used JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) to transmit the data between the front and back end of the website, which was made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (React.js, Node.js). I used Tailwind CSS and React.js to create an interactive, visually appealing stock dashboard that would help with such a data-intensive website </p>

        <h3>Ad-Blocker Chrome Extension</h3>
        <p>Created an ad-blocker Chrome extension that will hopefully make its way into the Google Chrome Web Store. I created this project through a tutorial online and fine-tuned it using the help of artificial intelligence (AI). I used JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) to set the rules and instructions for how the extension is to block ad-producing domains </p>

        <h3>Covid-19 Simulator</h3>
        <p>In high school, I developed a COVID-19 simulation model using p5.js, a JavaScript library, to visualize the virus and its spread within a population represented as dots </p>
